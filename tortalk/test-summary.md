# TorTalk Test Summary

We've created several test files for the TorTalk application:

## Unit Tests

1. **AuthContext.test.tsx**
   - Tests user registration, login, and logout functionality
   - Verifies deterministic user ID generation based on username
   - Mocks the encryption utility to avoid issues with window.crypto

2. **ChatContext.test.tsx**
   - Tests contact management (adding contacts, setting active contact)
   - Tests message sending functionality
   - Verifies deterministic contact ID generation based on username
   - Mocks socket.io for communication testing

3. **MessageArea.test.tsx**
   - Tests rendering of messages between users
   - Tests message sending through the UI
   - Tests handling of different message states (no active contact, no messages)
   - Mocks the ChatContext and AuthContext for isolated testing

## Integration Tests

1. **integration.test.tsx**
   - Tests the full user flow: registration, adding contacts, and sending messages
   - Mocks socket.io to simulate server responses
   - Verifies that the UI updates correctly after each action

## Test Setup

We've also created several configuration files to support testing:

1. **jest.config.js**
   - Configures Jest to work with TypeScript
   - Sets up the test environment (jsdom)
   - Configures test file patterns and coverage reporting

2. **setupTests.ts**
   - Mocks window.crypto for encryption functions
   - Mocks localStorage for persistent storage
   - Suppresses console errors during tests

## Mock Files

1. **__mocks__/encryption.ts**
   - Provides mock implementations of encryption functions
   - Returns predictable values for testing purposes

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following commands:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run a specific test file
npm test -- src/__tests__/AuthContext.test.tsx

# Run all tests without watching for changes
npm run test:all
```

## Test Coverage

The tests cover the following functionality:

- User authentication (registration, login, logout)
- Contact management (adding contacts, setting active contact)
- Message handling (sending, receiving, displaying)
- UI interactions (form submission, button clicks)
- Error handling (missing data, failed operations)

## Future Test Improvements

1. Add more integration tests for error scenarios
2. Add tests for the server-side code
3. Add end-to-end tests with a real browser
4. Add performance tests for encryption operations
