# TorTalk Test Results Summary

## Test Execution

We ran the tests for the TorTalk application and found that some tests are passing while others are failing. Here's a summary of the results:

### Passing Tests

1. **Simple Component Test**
   - The basic test for rendering a simple component is passing.
   - This confirms that the testing environment is set up correctly for basic React component testing.

2. **Some AuthContext Tests**
   - Some of the authentication context tests appear to be passing.
   - These tests verify user registration, login, and logout functionality.

### Failing Tests

1. **ContactList Tests**
   - Tests for online status badges are failing because the test is looking for elements with the role "status" which don't exist in the rendered component.
   - Tests for searching users are failing because the search button can't be found with the specified role and name.

2. **ChatContext Tests**
   - Some tests are failing due to issues with the contact count not matching expectations.
   - This suggests that the contact management functionality might not be working as expected in the test environment.

3. **MessageArea Tests**
   - These tests are failing, but we don't have detailed error information.

4. **Integration Tests**
   - The full user flow tests are likely failing due to the issues with the individual component tests.

## Issues Identified

1. **Component Structure Mismatches**
   - The tests are looking for elements with specific roles, classes, or text content that don't match what's actually rendered.
   - This could be due to changes in the component implementation that weren't reflected in the tests.

2. **Mock Implementation Issues**
   - Some mocks might not be correctly simulating the behavior of the real components or services.
   - For example, the mock for window.crypto needed to be updated to avoid TextEncoder issues.

3. **Test Environment Configuration**
   - We had to install jest-environment-jsdom to properly support the JSDOM environment for testing.
   - The TextEncoder polyfill was needed for the tests to run correctly.

## Next Steps

1. **Update Test Selectors**
   - Review and update the selectors used in tests to match the actual component structure.
   - For example, update the ContactList tests to use the correct selectors for badges and buttons.

2. **Improve Mock Implementations**
   - Ensure that all mocks correctly simulate the behavior of the real components and services.
   - This includes mocks for socket.io, encryption utilities, and context providers.

3. **Fix Component Issues**
   - Address any issues in the components that are causing the tests to fail.
   - This might involve updating the contact management functionality or message filtering logic.

4. **Run Tests Individually**
   - Continue running tests individually to isolate and fix issues one by one.
   - Once all individual tests pass, run the full test suite again.

## Conclusion

The testing setup is working correctly for basic tests, but there are issues with more complex tests that involve multiple components and services. By addressing the identified issues, we can improve the test coverage and ensure that the application works as expected.
